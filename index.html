            The Internet is a <span>large network</span> that links several independent networks

            to have made a <span>huge impact</span> since its introduction to the public,

              There can be several factors that affect the Internet usage rate. Some factors that are analyzed in this section 
              is the urban rate of a country and the average income per person in a country. It can be seen that the scatterplot
              on the left shows a correlation between the <span>Internet usage rate</span> and <span>urban rate</span> of a country, indicated by the increasing
              trend line on the plot. This means that the higher the urban rate of a country, the higher the Internet usage rate.

            <p class="card-text">
              The scatterplot on the right also shows a correlation between the <span>Internet usage rate</span> and the average <span>income per person</span> which is 
              indicated by the increasing trend line. Generally, this means that the higher the average income, the higher the Internet usage
              rate in the country. However, there are a few countries that don't correspond to this trend, as shown by the anomaly points on 
              the chart.
